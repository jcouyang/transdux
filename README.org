Managing React Component state in *Elegant & Functional* way with transducers and channels from ClojureScript

** Rationale
flux and redux are great and solve state management and communication pretty well.

*But* they are too complicated, users have to know toomany things about store, dispatcher, actions which they *shouldn't*

In reality what we have to do is actually just need to *talk* to *whatever* component I like and get my state from one *source of truth*, so the simplest way to do this is:

For component who has *actions*, only thing it have to define is what can it do.

For component who want to call other component's action, it directly *dispatch* a message to that component.

SO, all user have to know is to
- define *actions* for your component
- *dispatch* messages to *any component* you want to talk to

and leave all the other *dirty works* (stores, states) to our functional transducers, channels and pubsub that user don't really need to care about.

*The Big Picture*
[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABe_8eE6o2dGlZMCmNnBap_fXy83GvJe6gcB/image.jpg]]

We're using Channels/Actors Model from Clojure -- core.async, It's compile to JS by [[http://github.com/jcouyang/conjs][conjs]]

*Basic Idea*
we composed channels, subs, pubs, and transducers together like tunnels, every message goes through the tunnel will got process by the transducer with action function user provided.

so, whenever a message is dispatch to input channel, you'll get new state from the corresponding output channel. you don't need to care about how the dispatching really happen in the framework.

** Install
In your React project
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install transdux --save
#+END_SRC

** Usage
to wire in transdux, only 4 place you have to pay attention to.
*** 1. wrap you app with Transdux
#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <Transdux>
    <App/>
  </Transdux>
#+END_SRC
*** 2. define what your component can do
#+BEGIN_SRC js
// MainSection.jsx
let actions = {
  complete(msg, state){
    return {
      todos:state.todos.map(todo=>{
        if(todo.id==msg.id)
          todo.completed = !todo.completed
        return todo
      })
    }
  },
  clear(msg,state){
    return {
      todos: state.todos.filter(todo=>todo.completed==false)
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC
*** for Mixin lover
**** 3. mixin Transdux Mixin and Bind Actions
#+BEGIN_SRC js
// MainSection.jsx
  import {TxMixin} from 'transdux'
  let MainSection = React.createClass({
    mixins: [TxMixin],
    componentDidMount(){
      this.bindActions(actions)
    },
    ...
  })

#+END_SRC

**** 4. mixin and dispatch a message
#+BEGIN_SRC jsx
  //TodoItem.jsx
  import MainSection from './MainSection'
  let TodoItem = React.createClass({
      mixins: [TxMixin],
      render(){
          <input className="toggle"
          type="checkbox"
          checked={todo.completed}
          onChange={() => this.dispatch(MainSection, 'complete',{id:todo.id})} />

      }
  })
#+END_SRC

*** for ES6 class lover
**** 3. mixin transdux into Class
#+BEGIN_SRC js
    // TodoItem.jsx
    import {mixin} from 'transdux'
    let actions = {
      ...
    }
    class TodoItem extends React.Component {
      constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {editing:false};
      }
      ...
    }
    export default mixin(TodoItem, actions)

#+END_SRC

**** 4. dispatch a message
#+BEGIN_SRC jsx
  //TodoItem.jsx
  import MainSection from './MainSection'
  class TodoItem extends React.Component {
   ...
      render(){
          <input className="toggle"
          type="checkbox"
          checked={todo.completed}
          onChange={() => this.dispatch(MainSection, 'complete',{id:todo.id})} />

      }
   ...
  })
  export default mixin(TodoItem)

** Performance
for dispatching *1023 messages* at the same time, here is the Memory Usage and Time elapsed

Elapsed 4ms
#+END_EXAMPLE

Yeah, I know, it's slower then redux, and I'm working on it.
But, it's not bad, it's totally reasonable trade-off a little performance to get writing code which is more composable, reusable, testable and easy to reason about.
