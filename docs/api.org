** mixin
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
this is for ES6 class
#+END_QUOTE

=mixin(ComponentClass:class, actions:object, JsToImmutableFunction:function, ImmutableToJsFunction:function):object=

=JsToImmutableFunction= and =ImmutableToJsFunction= are *optional*

example:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
    import {mixin} from 'transdux'
    let actions = {
      ...
    }
    class TodoItem extends React.Component {
      ...
    }
    export default mixin(TodoItem, actions)
#+END_SRC
** dispatch
=dispatch(TargetComponentClass:class, actionName:string, value:any)=

example:

when component =TodoItem= want to send message to component =MainSection= 's =complete= action.
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  import MainSection from './MainSection'
  class TodoItem extends React.Component {
   ...
      render(){
          <input className="toggle"
          onChange={() => this.dispatch(MainSection, 'complete',{id:todo.id})} />

      }
   ...
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One thing you may need to notice is that message between component is *Class* level, not *Instance* level. For example, if you have multiple =MainSection= components, they will all reveive the same massage from =TodoItem=.
#+END_QUOTE

** actions
action is no more than just a normal javascript object, which contains all the action functions.

but you have to pay a little attention to make all function in it. All functions should return object, which normally just like what you wanna put in the parameter of function =this.setState=.

** bindActions
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
for react mixin
#+END_QUOTE

=bindActions(actions:object, JsToImmutableFunction:function, ImmutableToJsFunction:function)=

=JsToImmutableFunction= and =ImmutableToJsFunction= are *optional*

example:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  import {TxMixin} from 'transdux'
  let MainSection = React.createClass({
    mixins: [TxMixin],
    componentDidMount(){
      this.bindActions(actions)
    },
    ...
  })
#+END_SRC

for mixin, you have to maually call =bindActions= some where, it's recommended to put it in =componentDidMount()= where not blocking your component's render.
